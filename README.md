âž¢ ðŸ“… Century Calendar â€“ Java Program
    â€¢ This Java program determines the day of the week for any given date between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2100.
    â€¢ It uses a predefined century calendar logic based on year codes and month codes, without relying on built-in date/time libraries.

âž¢ How It Works:

1. User Input
  â€¢ The program prompts the user to enter a date in the format:
    DD-MM-YYYY
    
  â€¢ The input is validated for:
    â€¢ Correct day range (1â€“31)
    â€¢ Correct month range (1â€“12)
    â€¢ Year within 2001â€“2100

2. Year Code Calculation (yearCode method)
  â€¢ Uses a preloaded mapping of each year in the range 2001â€“2100 to a unique year code (Aâ€“N).
  â€¢ This mapping allows quick lookup of the base offset for the year.

3. Month Code Calculation (monthCode method)
  â€¢ Uses the year code and month number to fetch the monthâ€™s numeric code from pre-defined arrays.
  â€¢ Different year codes have different month code tables.

4. Weekday Determination (getWeek method)
  â€¢ Combines the month code and day of the month to determine the weekday.
  â€¢ Uses an indexed list of weekdays:
      Monday â†’ Tuesday â†’ ... â†’ Sunday â†’ (repeats)
  â€¢ The offset ensures the right weekday is chosen for the given date.

5. Output
  â€¢ Prints the result in the format:
      DD-MM-YYYY is <Weekday>

  
âž¢ Example Run:

  Enter date, month and year within the range of 2001 to 2100 years in the form of DD-MM-YYYY: 15-08-2025
  15-8-2025 is Friday

  
âž¢ Key Features

 â€¢ Works offline without external libraries.
 â€¢ Covers the entire 21st century (2001â€“2100).
 â€¢ Accurate weekday calculation using static lookup tables.
 â€¢ Simple input validation.
 â€¢ Custom algorithm instead of built-in Java date utilities.

âž¢ File Structure
    Main.java
  
  Contains:
   â€¢ main â€“ Handles input/output and validation.
   â€¢ yearCode â€“ Finds the yearâ€™s code letter.
   â€¢ monthCode â€“ Finds the numeric code for the month/year combination.
   â€¢ getWeek â€“ Determines the final weekday name.
